# UQcourselistCrawling
The University Of Queensland - UQ course crawling.
This one part of the private repository Course Recommendation, but this one is open sourced. As direct scripts, it is easy to read and just have a clone or download then you can run it.

## How to use
Just feel free to run the demo.py and you will be okay with the result.
The data will be the course code (which is corresponding to courseCode.pickle) and the detailed description (corresponding to detail)
